# blink-http
The blink-http plugin allows the user to perform different HTTP actions. You can use this plugin to interact with different web APIs and services.

---
**Currently, the following HTTP actions are supported:**

## DELETE
The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.

## GET
The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.

## PATCH
The `PATCH` method applies partial modifications to a resource.
## POST
The `POST` method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

## PUT
The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
