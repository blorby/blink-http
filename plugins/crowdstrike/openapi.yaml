  title: CrowdStrike API Specification
  description: |-
    Use this API specification as a reference for the API endpoints you can use to interact with your Falcon environment. These endpoints support authentication via OAuth2 and interact with detections and network containment. For detailed usage guides and more information about API endpoints that don't yet support OAuth2, see our [documentation inside the Falcon console](https://falcon.us-2.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation).


      To use the APIs described below, combine the base URL with the path shown for each API endpoint. For commercial cloud customers, your base URL is `https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com`.

      Each API endpoint requires authorization via an OAuth2 token. Your first API request should retrieve an OAuth2 token using the `oauth2/token` endpoint, such as `https://api.us-2.crowdstrike.com/oauth2/token`. For subsequent requests, include the OAuth2 token in an HTTP authorization header. Tokens expire after 30 minutes, after which you should make a new token request to continue making API requests.

      operationId: Submit
      requestBody:
        description: |-
          Submit either a URL or a sample SHA256 for sandbox analysis. The sample file must have been previously uploaded through `/samples/entities/samples/v2`. You must specify a JSON object that includes the `falconx.SubmissionParametersV1` key/value pairs shown below.

          **`environment_id`**: Specifies the sandbox environment used for analysis. Values:

          - `300`: Linux Ubuntu 16.04, 64-bit
          - `200`: Android (static analysis)
          - `160`: Windows 10, 64-bit
          - `110`: Windows 7, 64-bit
          - `100`: Windows 7, 32-bit

          **`sha256`** ID of the sample, which is a SHA256 hash value. Find a sample ID from the response when uploading a malware sample or search with `/falconx/queries/submissions/v1`.The `url` parameter must be unset if `sha256` is used.

          **`url`** A web page or file URL. It can be HTTP(S) or FTP. The `sha256` parameter must be unset if `url` is used.

          **`action_script`** (optional): Runtime script for sandbox analysis. Values:

          - `default`

          - `default`: Fully operating network
          - `tor`: Route network traffic via TOR
          - `simulated`: Simulate network traffic
          - `offline`: No network traffic

          **`submit_name`** (optional): Name of the malware sample that's used for file type detection and analysis

          **`system_date`** (optional): Set a custom date in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` for the sandbox environment

          As a best practice, we recommend omitting `password`. If single sign-on is enabled for your customer account, the `password` attribute is ignored. If single sign-on is not enabled, we send a user activation request to their email address when you create the user with no `password`. The user should use the activation email to set their own password.
